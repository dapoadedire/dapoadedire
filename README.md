Hello there,

Software Developer and occasional technical writer.  
Active member of tech and engineering communities, including [GDSAOAU]() and [IEEEOAUSB]().  
I mostly build with TypeScript and Python.  
Currently learning Golang.

I'm also diving into backend systems, DevOps, and DSA (road to FAANG? Maybe, lol).

You can contact me on Discord: dapoadedire, or via email: adedireadedapo19@gmail.com

Fun fact: I love tinkering with IoT devices and exploring how AI can enhance everyday life.
