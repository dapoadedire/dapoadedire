Hello there,

Software Developer and occasional technical writer.  
Active member of tech and engineering communities, including [GDSAOAU]() and [IEEEOAUSB]().  
I mostly build with TypeScript and Python.  
Currently looking into web animations and web performance,learning Golang on the side too.

I'm also planning to dive into backend systems, DevOps, and DSA (road to FAANG? Maybe, lol).

You can contact me on Discord: dapoadedire, or via email: adedireadedapo19@gmail.com

Fun fact: I love tinkering with IoT devices and exploring how AI can enhance everyday life.
