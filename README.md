Hi there! I'm a software developer and open source enthusiast who is passionate about collaborating and learning new things. I am currently looking for internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the field.

You can check out my portfolio website,  [dapoadedire.tech](https://dapoadedire.tech) , to see some of my work. I am skilled in a variety of languages and tools, including [HTML](), [CSS]() , [Javascript](), [Python](), [Django](), [DRF](), [Git]() and [Postman]().
